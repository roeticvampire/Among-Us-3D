# Among-Us-3D
An OCD trigger for real artists, but Among Us in 3D.

## The Current State
The project was ambitiously started as a direct motivation to try rebuilding the networking mechanism of Among us, and it was at the time that the hype had recently died. Due to some unfortunate reasons (read: ignorance, college and my lack of interest to finish it), this remains an incomplete OCD trigger artwork that has player movement, tasks and venting mechanism implemented. 

## Tech Stack Used
- Unity
- Blender
- Mirror (I swear I tried)

## TODO (Maybe one day? Probably not?)
- Implement the Imposter mechanics and the dope killing stuff.
- Implement the networking solution to actually facilitate the multiplayer gameplay, since otherwise there is NO gameplay?

## Footnote
It's been nine months (sus) since any progress has been made in this, and I can firmly say that just like my friends have given up on me, I've given up all my hopes of coming back to finish it. The reason it's going public now, is so maybe one day we can laugh at the horrific blender skills I have (read: I can't Blender.exe) and maybe if someone ever seeing this is interested to continue, you may as well honor me by forking with my <s>girl</s> repository. :)
Okay Fin.
